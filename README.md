=======

A new implementation of the Arc language

This is a major work in progress, and will change quite often. The core is a bare-minimum C interpreter designed for building Arc on top of. It currently consists of less than 400 lines of code.

Special Forms:
==============
```assign, if, while, fn```

Builtin Functions:
==================
```is, +, -, *, /, pr, cons, car, cdr```
